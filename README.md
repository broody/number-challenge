# Number Challenge Game

**Number Challenge** is a fully onchain game built using [Dojo Engine](https://dojoengine.org) on [Starknet](https://starknet.io) that blends strategy and chance. The goal is to place 20 randomly generated numbers into slots in ascending order to win significant prizes.

## Gameplay

- **Number Range**: Each number ranges from **1 to 1000**.
- **Sequential Placement**: Receive one random number at a time and place it immediately into one of 20 slots.
- **Ascending Order**: All numbers must be placed in strictly increasing order.
- **No Rearrangement**: Once a number is placed, it cannot be moved or swapped.

## Powerups (WIP)

Enhance your gameplay by purchasing and equipping powerups using NUMS tokens:

- **Reroll**: Discard the current number and receive a new one.
- **Boost High/Low**: Next number is guaranteed to be in the upper or lower half of the range.
- **Erase**: Remove a previously placed number.
- **Shift**: Move a placed number up or down one slot if space allows.
- **Foresight**: Preview the next number after the upcoming one.
- **Double Up**: Multiply the current number by 2 (up to 1000).
- **Halve**: Divide the current number by 2, rounding up.
- **Mirror**: Transform the current number to its complementary value within the range.
- **Override**: Place a number even if it breaks the ascending order, once per game.
